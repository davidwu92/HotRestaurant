# HotRestaurant

HotRestaurant is a restaurant table reservation simulator, where Chef Wu's restaurant starts with exactly five tables available and you are attempting to populate the tables and waitlist.

To start the app, first run server.js as a node application to start the server. Then, the restaurant's home page will have two buttons: an option to view tables as they are currently reserved, and an option to fill out a reservation form.

Thank you for your time.
